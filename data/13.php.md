PHP was the first server-side web language I learnt. Of course, I don't practice PHP on its own, I'd rather use CMS and frameworks. But it's important to know what you can do with plain PHP.

GIF and image generation on the fly, padding data among servers, mail sending, APIs features... are things that I've done in PHP.

This language has also evolved during my career. Using [] instead of array() (> PHP 5.5) may seem little, but I know it's a big change, and all servers don't have the PHP version to back that.
