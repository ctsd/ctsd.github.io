I confess here my love to Facebook Messenger bots. Ever since Facebook rolled out its platform for developing bots, I've kept an eye on it. I think it's the future, integrating businesses into one app is something that already works -- and that I can testify -- with Wechat in China.

Before using Botkit, I even started coding my own wrapper. Now I've worked on multiple bots.
