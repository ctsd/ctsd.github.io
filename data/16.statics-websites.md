Big trending topic these last years, I had to dive into static sites generator (SSG). What's not to love with a solution that prevents almost any security breach ?

Hugo, Jekyll, SSG + Contentfull, ... There are many combinations out there to get a static website running in no time. But, it's not super mature yet, difficult to put a SSG in the hands of a client, and push him to work with Markdown, which has very limited range compared to a HTML WYSIWYG editor such as CKEditor.

By the way, I've worked on a SSG plugin for Grav CMS that combines the need for a really secure website, and an administrable website.
