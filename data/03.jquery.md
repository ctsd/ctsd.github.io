As explained in the CSS section, I moved all my animations and transitions from jQuery to CSS. It allows to gain on performance and movement fluidity, especially on mobile.

Enough about bad stuff. jQuery remains a piece a piece that I can't overlook. Simply because AJAX is a big part of websites. Creating dynamic content pages is something that I do best with jQuery.
