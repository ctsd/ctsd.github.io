I have to admit Symfony is not my favorite framework. I often find it too heavy for the needs of the client. It feels like someone would ask for a pet, and you're giving him an elephant. But Symfony even I have to admit it is really great for maintaining and code legacy. Big guns don't always outrun small fast pistols.

Nonetheless, I had to work with Symfony on various occasions during my previous job, on maintaining and evolving features. That's why I would say I'm not an expert at it, but I can handle it properly.
