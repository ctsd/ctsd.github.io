Of all the frameworks I've tested, Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, ... Yii is the one I prefer. It is well documented, has a good user community, is being maintained and evolved, and is really flexible compared to a Symfony.

With its Gii plugin, it can generate models, controllers and views based on a table structure, which is really a killer feature.
