I consider working without any VCS isolates you from sharing your work. I personally never go from work without committing what I've done. I strongly advocate use of branches, especially since I'm in charge of other developers.

Familiar with SVN, and Git, it's honest to say that in my world, there cannot be a day without a commit.
