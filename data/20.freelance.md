I was a freelance for a long time. And being a freelance is not only being free, it includes way more duties than rights.

Organization, planning management, client communication, self promotion, ... are things that are super important for a freelancer. More than being a good developer. I'm not a freelancer anymore, but I've kept this great experience in my mind, and I consider it still helps me in my everyday job and life.
