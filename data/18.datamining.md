Working with community managers often means retrieving data for them. Over the past years, I was in close relation with these people, and worked on digital marketing campaigns based on social networks.

So obviously, I've integrated APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Youtube, ...), and I know how to get and analyze data from them.
