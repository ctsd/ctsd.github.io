Even though I do not really like it, I recognize coding emailings is a particularly difficult thing to do for modern developers. Because you simply have to forget everything you know/assess.

Exit inline-block, floats, margins, ... Welcome tables, padding-only (but not on <p>), and so many features that make CSS magic. Coding emailings is about putting good modern web developments guidelines aside, and respecting a complete other set of rules.

I've completed 40+ emailings at my current position. Some were responsive, some were not. All of them where difficult to test/optimize among mail clients. But it's the game.
