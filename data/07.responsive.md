That topic is a big one. I've seen along my work experience websites going from desktop-oriented to mobile-oriented. Though the clients I've worked with did not understand the necessity of mobile-first websites, I know how to work with graphic designers in order to prevent typical problems that occur when going form a desktop webdesign to a mobile one.

On the technical side, I've used grids for a long long time, enhancing responsiveness. Of course, it's not magical, but it helps a lot in setting standards across pages in a same website. Testing on multiple devices, on multiple browsers are part of my quality checklist before deploying.
