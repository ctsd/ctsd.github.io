I've discovered Bolt CMS last year. What I love about it is that it's not super heavy like a Drupal, has a dynamic content-type system unlike Wordpress, and it's really flexible.

So many things that make it a good base for rapid coding, expanding features in the future, and concentrating on front-end integration.
