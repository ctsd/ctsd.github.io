As soon as I started working with LESS, I started using Grunt. It could have been Gulp, which I've also used a couple times, but I sat alongside Grunt due to its never-ending useful tasks.

Today, LESS compiling, uglifying and CSS minifying are mandatory tasks in my Gruntfile. And progressively I'm adding up HTML minifying, image compressing to further enhance performance of the website.

I've tried Grunt FTP & MySQL deployments, but it wasn't a conclusive experience compared to other deployment tools.
