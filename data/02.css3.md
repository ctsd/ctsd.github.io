Aww, CSS3, its advanced selectors and beautiful animations...

Thnaks to it, I've abandoned jQuery transitions, appear effects, and adopted a clean CSS-exclusive approach for animations.

Having worked and supervised interns, I sometimes had problems with too much specification and weird naming conventions.

That's why I struggle and work on abstracting CSS structures, minimalizing CSS, and coding a readable and easy to navigate stylesheets.
